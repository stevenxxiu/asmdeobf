- It's better to perform control flow simplification in the cfg pass, and include all control blocks
- In control flow simplification, functions with only 1 block and just change the stack can be merged in
- Revert back from ssa form after deobfuscation for ease of reading
- To better locate where blocks are and what we have missing do coverage in js (draw as canvas)
- Present cfg in javascript, the result would look something like ida's analysis and generate a graph, with a list of functions on left panel and accesses on top
