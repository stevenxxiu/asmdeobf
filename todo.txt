- More unit tests for constant propagator extract.py (see readme for some examples)
- Allow manually specifying functions to be inlined and analysis stop address
- To better locate where blocks are and what we have missing do coverage in js (draw as canvas)
- Present cfg in javascript, the result would look something like ida's analysis and generate a graph, with a list of functions on left panel and accesses on top
- The user should deal with self-modifying code, in order to do this, add an instruction change hook, that whenever this instruction is encountered, it will be changed to user-specified esil
- Instead of assume_new, let the user analyze a function til some address, then use the end state to continue analyzing, like analyzing a packer once section is decrypted.
