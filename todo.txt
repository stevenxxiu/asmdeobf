- remove useless instructions, such as 'eax = eax'
- handle proc calls (analyze function if not already analyzed, and re-run functions which are in-lined)
- Allow manually specifying functions to be inlined. This is necessary in order to prevent duplicate code blocks from being run.
- To better locate where blocks are and what we have missing do coverage in js (draw as canvas)
- Present cfg in javascript, the result would look something like ida's analysis and generate a graph, with a list of functions on left panel and accesses on top
- The user should deal with self-modifying code, in order to do this, add an instruction change hook, that whenever this instruction is encountered, it will be changed to user-specified esil
